Approach the enemy to deliver a powerful blow. Not only does this skill greatly help fill the Focus gauge, but through the skill [Unleashed Rage After Effect](/skill-tree/skills#unleashed-rage-after-effect), the critical hit rate increases for a short period after using the skill.

[Unleashed Rage](/skill-tree/skills#unleashed-rage) gauge builds from <Tooltip term="PA" />s, Relentless Blade and from [<Tooltip term="StepC" /> Weapon Action](/moveset/counters#stepc-wa).

:::tip
[Unleashed Rage](/skill-tree/skills#unleashed-rage) requires 100 Rage to be used and will grant you invincibility frames for the entire duration of the skill.

## <img src="/skill/38px-NGSUISkillGunbladeFocusOverdrive.png" alt="icon" className="heading-icon"/>Gunblade Focus Overdrive
Activating this skill will start a short animation. After the activation, you will be granted buffs for a short time period.
For more information on the buffs check out [Gunblade Focus Overdrive](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus-overdrive)

When [Gunblade Focus Reset <Tooltip term="PP" /> Gain](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus-reset-pp-gain) was learned, the skill will trigger and recover some <Tooltip term="PP" />.

Re-activating this skill while it's in effect, unleashes a powerful finishing move that generates a special zone similar to the visuals seen in the [<Tooltip term="PB" />](/moveset/photon-blast).
You will be granted invincibility frames during the entire animation of the finisher as well.

:::tip
During both the activation and the finisher animation you will be granted invincibility frames.

The activation takes 1.4 seconds when not inputting another attack and 0.67 seconds if you do.
