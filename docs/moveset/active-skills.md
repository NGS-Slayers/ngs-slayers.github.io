When the bar above this skill icon fills, you can activate it to dash to a nearby selected enemy and attack it with a powerful slash.
Itâ€™s excellent for filling [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus), and with [Unleashed Rage After Effect](/skill-tree/skills#unleashed-rage-after-effect) the skill also grants a short-term increase to Critical Hit Rate after use.

:::tip
* [Unleashed Rage](/skill-tree/skills#unleashed-rage) builds from [PAs](/moveset/photon-arts), Relentless Blade and from [Step Counter Weapon Action](/moveset/counters#stepc-wa).
* The bar requires 100 Rage to be full and grants invincibility frames for the skill's entire duration.

Activating this skill triggers a short animation, then grants temporary buffs.
For details on the buffs, see [Gunblade Focus Overdrive](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus-overdrive)
If [Gunblade Focus Reset PP Gain](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus-reset-pp-gain) is learned, resetting Focus will additionally restore some PP.
Re-activating this skill while it's in effect, unleashes a powerful finishing move.

:::tip
* You gain invincibility frames during both the activation and the finisher animations.
* The activation takes 1.4 seconds when not following up with another attack and 0.67 seconds if you do.
