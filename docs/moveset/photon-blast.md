The Photon Blast is a powerful, weapon-specific attack.  
The Gunblade’s Photon Blast is a two-stage move: 
The first stage dashes you to a nearby targeted enemy and releases a series of slashes.
The second stage fires multiple projectiles at the enemy from range.

:::tip
* You gain invincibility frames throughout the entire attack animation.
* You can change targets before the second stage takes place.
