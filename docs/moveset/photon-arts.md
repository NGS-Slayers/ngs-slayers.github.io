Gunblade PAs change based on whether a directional input is held when the PA is activated.

If you are familiar with the Fighter Class, you might notice a similarity with Fighter Skip Arts.

:::tip
* Canceling a PA with a Step Dodge is more generous than with a [Weapon Action](/moveset/weapon-action), so if you find yourself stuck in some Photon Arts consider using a [Step Counter](/moveset/counters#stepc-na) instead.
