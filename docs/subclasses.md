If the enemies you are fighting have breakable parts, or you need to get downs quicker, then the Bouncer subclass is your go-to.
Partial Destroy Advantage increases the damage you deal by 1% for each part broken on an enemy (and also reduces damage taken by 2%). This stacks up to 3 times!
Defeat Amplifier increases Physical and Elemental Down Factor by 15%, allowing you to get faster downs.

### <img src="/class/UINGSClassSl.png" alt="icon" className="heading-icon"/><img src="/class/UINGSClassFo.png" alt="" className="heading-icon"/>Force
Force is the best subclass for mobbing thanks to Eradication PP Gain which restores PP for each nearby enemy defeated.
It is not as useful for bossing, but it does still help by providing increased natural PP recovery (from PP Recovery Boost) and the ability to very quickly restore PP using the PP Conversion skill at the cost of some HP.

### <img src="/class/UINGSClassSl.png" alt="icon" className="heading-icon"/><img src="/class/UINGSClassTe.png" alt="" className="heading-icon"/>Techter
Increases [Photon Blast](/moveset/photon-blast) accumulation rate by 20% when you are near a boss thanks to Awake Aile.
Weak Element Amplifier further boosts Photon Blast accumulation rate by 20% if your attacks' element matches the elemental weakness of your enemies, which applies when using an elemental weapon.
Techter subclass is great for bossing because it allows you to generate Photon Blasts faster which could be helpful in fights where you do not have the Photon Blast ready in time or in longer fights it could even give you an additional Photon Blast.
Synergizes well with weapons that come with Potentials that further increase Photon Blast accumulation.

### <img src="/class/UINGSClassSl.png" alt="icon" className="heading-icon"/><img src="/class/UINGSClassFi.png" alt="" className="heading-icon"/>Fighter
Increases damage against downed enemies by 5% and increases PP recovery when attacking downed enemies by 40% thanks to Defeat Advantage and Defeat PP Recovery.
This can be a decent option if the above mentioned subclass benefits don't come into play or you can ensure the enemy being downed often enough.
