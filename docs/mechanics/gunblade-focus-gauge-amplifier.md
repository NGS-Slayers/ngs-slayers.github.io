The reason why we do not put more than one point into that skill is because it can cause diminishing returns.

For example if you use a [Supercharged Normal Attack](/moveset/normal-attack#scna) into a [Step Counter Weapon Action](/moveset/counters#stepc-wa) you will generate less [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) with the skill at Level 5 than at Level 1.

Using the skill at Level 1 will generate 232.5 [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus).
$
(65*1.5)+(90*1.5) = 232.5
$

Using the skill at Level 5 will generate 220 [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus).
$
(65*2)+90 = 220
$
