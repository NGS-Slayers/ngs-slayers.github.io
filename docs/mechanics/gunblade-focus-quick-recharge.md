With the Patch from 06/07/2023 came a new Slayer Class skill which might sound good at first but looking further into it might not be worth your skill point.

* The skill amplifies our [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) generation by 120% after using the finisher from [Gunblade Focus Overdrive](/moveset/active-skills#gunblade-focus-overdrive) for a duration of 20 seconds.

* This effect does stack with [Gunblade Focus Gauge Amplifier](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus-gauge-amplifier)

Before we get into the pros and cons of the skill let us create a scenario in which we can compare the buildup with and without the skill. 500 Focus is needed to reach [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) Level 5 and while attacking boss enemies our [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) generation is 5 times the original [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) value of our attacks. In this example I will just chain a bunch of [Stay Arts Flowing Sirius Stage 1 to 2](/moveset/photon-arts#sfs12) together until we reach [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) Level 5. Time to do the math without using the skill first. I will round the amount of times required to use the skill to approach an in game scenario.

* Without using the skill it takes us around 7 of these or 21.7 seconds:
$$
14.2*5 = 71
500/71 = 7.04225352113
7/3.10 = 21.7
$$

* With using the skill it would take us around 6 of these or 18.6 seconds:
$$
(14.2*5)1.2 = 85.2
500/85.2 = 5.86854460094
6*3.10 = 18.6
$$

The above example is a 14% difference since we are not able to make use of the 20 second buff duration in a scenario in which the enemy does not move.
* The skill is not active at the start of a fight.
* The skill does not help us when we lose [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) to any other means than using [Gunblade Focus Overdrive Finisher](/moveset/active-skills#gunblade-focus-overdrive).
* Buff duration has to be fully utilized, every second of not making use of the skills buff duration decreases the impact it has.
* Killing an enemy with [Gunblade Focus Overdrive Finisher](/moveset/active-skills#gunblade-focus-overdrive) will also cause us to lose some buff duration since in most cases there will be a small delay until we fight the next enemy.
* We usually build and want to build [Gunblade Focus](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus) when an enemy is able to move so using [Counters](/moveset/counters) will shrink the difference in time even more.
* The skill does not help if you happen to use your [Photon Blast](/moveset/photon-blast) right after using [Gunblade Focus Overdrive Finisher](/moveset/active-skills#gunblade-focus-overdrive).
