Explaining Slayers skills and dividing them into two categories for ones that you should always allocate skill points to referred to as the core skills and optional skills.

## Core Skills

### <img src="/skill/38px-NGSUISkillBladeCounter.png" alt="icon" className="heading-icon"/>Gunblade Focus
Build up the Focus Gauge by hitting enemies. Attack Potency and Offensive <Tooltip term="PP" /> Recovery increase and <Tooltip term="PP" /> Consumption decreases in accordance with the gauge level. The Focus Gauge will reset to zero after 10 seconds pass without hitting an enemy.

| Skill Level | Potency Increase Per Level  | <Tooltip term="PP" /> Consumption Reduction Per Level  | Offensive <Tooltip term="PP" /> Recovery Per Level  |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 1% | 1% | 2% |

The UI element at the bottom of your screen helps you identify your current Focus Level and shows you the time that is left until your Focus Level will be reset.
The small bar degressing over time shows when your Focus Level will reeset and the big bar split into five rectangles shows your Focus Level.

  </ImageTableFigure>
</ImageTable>

:::info
Each Bar represents 100 Focus.

500 Focus is needed to reach Focus Level 5. The Focus Level Indicator will turn from blue to yellow.

When [Gunblade Focus Overflow](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus-overflow) was learned the skill will then activate and make it easier for you to gain Rage.

When [Gunblade Focus Overdrive](/skill-tree/skills#gunblade-focus-overdrive) was learned you will also be able to activate it. It is generally treated the same as Gunblade Focus Level 5
